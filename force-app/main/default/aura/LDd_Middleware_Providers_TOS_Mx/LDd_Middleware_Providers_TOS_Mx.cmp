            <p>11.1.	<b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations and understandings and contains the entire agreement between the Parties. DoorDash may revise the terms herein from time to time and we will notify Middleware Provider of material revisions. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and acknowledged by a duly authorized representative of each Party. No failure or delay of either Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy.
            </p>
            <p>11.2.	<b>Assignment.</b> This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their successors and assigns. Neither Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the express written consent of the other Party. Neither Party has any authority to enter into any agreement on behalf of the other Party, draw, accept, or endorse any bill on behalf of the other Party or to use the name of the other Party with respect to its products or services except to the extent as contained herein. Both Parties agree that they shall not transfer their rights under the Agreement to anyone else without the prior written consent of the other Party.

            </p>
            <p>11.5.	<b>No Waiver.</b> Nonperformance of either Party, except for the making of payments, shall be excused to the extent where failure to perform is beyond the control and not caused by the negligence of the nonperforming Party.
            </p>
            <p>11.6. 	<b>Press, Non-disparagement.</b> Neither Middleware Provider nor DoorDash shall issue any press release or public statement regarding the relationship between the Parties or the nature of the services without the prior written consent of the other Party. Neither Party shall issue any statement about the other Party that could be interpreted as disparaging the other Party or its operations, even if such statement does not name the other Party specifically. Nothing in this section prevents a party from making statements as compelled by law or regulation as provided in Section 4.2.            </p>
            <p>11.7.	<b>Arbitration.</b><br/>
                <p><b>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all disputes arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the relationship between the Parties and their personnel. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement. 
                    </b>
                </p><b>If Middleware Provider is an entity based in Australia:  </b>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be brought by arbitration, will be conducted by the Australian Disputes Centre (“ADC”) under its then-current arbitration rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by ADC’s rules. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of Middleware Provider and DoorDash. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on Middleware Provider and DoorDash.
            </p>            
            <p><b>If Middleware Provider is an entity based in Canada: </b>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to DoorDash’s registered agent. The arbitration will be administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement before one arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and if no agreement can be reached within thirty (30) days of commencement of arbitration, then by one arbitrator appointed by the ICDR. The arbitration shall take place in Toronto, Ontario, or any other jurisdiction mutually agreed upon by Middleware Provider and DoorDash. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the ICDR arbitration rules then in effect. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by ICDR’s rules. If ICDR is not available to arbitrate, the Parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
            </p>
            <p><b>If Middleware Provider is an entity based outside of Canada and Australia:  </b>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, California before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the resulting Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude Parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. This arbitration agreement explicitly supersedes any and all different or contradictory terms included in the Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>11.8.	<b>Enforceability.</b> Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The prohibition on or unenforceability of any provision in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p class="left-margin">11.9.	<b>Attorneys’ Fees.</b> In any legal action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-margin">11.10.	<b>Survival.</b> The rights and obligations set forth herein, which by their nature should, or by their express terms do, survive or extend beyond the termination or expiration of these terms shall so survive and extend.
