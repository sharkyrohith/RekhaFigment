                <h2>About The DCC</h2>
                <div>
                    The inaugural DCC was founded in the summer of 2019 and had representation from Dashers in the US
                    and
                    Canada. In January 2021, we launched distinct councils for the US, Canada, and Australia to hear
                    from
                    even more Dashers globally.

                    DCC members serve a six-month term as representatives of the broader Dasher community. These Dashers
                    advise DoorDash on key issues, act as a sounding board for ideas, and shape DoorDashâ€™s
                    future by testing new product features. The DCC also strengthens the Dasher community by voicing
                    community concerns and planning
                    community-building events. After their term, members become <a
