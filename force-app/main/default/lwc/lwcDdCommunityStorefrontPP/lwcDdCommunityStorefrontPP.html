       <p>Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web
           browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain

       <div class="alpha-title">b. Web Beacons</div>
   
       <p>Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that
           may be included on the Storefront Services to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure
           the performance of the Storefront Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the
           effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are
           typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).</p>
   
       <div class="alpha-title">c. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies</div>
   
       <p>We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on the Storefront

           Storefront Services or on other devices, apps or websites. </p>
   
       <div class="alpha-title">d. Interest-Based Advertising</div>
   
       <p>We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile
           device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such
           as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content
           and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of cross device
           tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings. We may also use
           cross-device targeting to help identify our users and serve advertising. This type of advertising is often
           called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app”
           advertising.</p>
   
       <p>You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by
           visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">Opt-Out link</a> or (ii) the Digital Advertising
           Alliance’s Consumer <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Opt-Out link</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google
           display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a> page.</p>
   
       <p>Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us. However, in that case, the
           advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or
           whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.</p>
